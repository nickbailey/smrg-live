Live Software Distribution/Demonstration images
===============================================

These are debian live-build configurations to build a
hybrid iso (one that can be written to a USB stick or
to a CD-ROM).

The base distribution is wheezy (currently testing).
At the time of writing, testing is young, and the live-build
utilities it contains do not produce a usb-hdd image
correctly. This will change when live-build starts to
work better.

The live image produced is based on packages obtained
from debian main with the following exceptions:

 * alsa-firmware-loaders (from contrib)
   and its dependencies
 * firmware for the Tascam US-122 used locally
   at the SMRG: this was obtained from
      ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/firmware/

The rest of the material here is by members of the
SMRG, in alphabetical order:

   Nick Bailey
   Bill Evans

and is made available under the GPL and, where noted,
other licences.

SMRG Applications on this distribution
--------------------------------------

 * 19cl: a PD application to allow a WX7 wind controller
         and two foot switches to be played in 19ET

Building
--------

   apt-get install live-build
   lb clean && lb build

produces a file called binary-hybrid.iso which can be
dd'd onto a USB flash key (NOT a partition of it!) or
used by (e.g.) wodim to write a CD.

live-build issues
-----------------

As a bug-fix, the file

   ./config/binary_local-hooks/006-kernel.binary.sh

contains code to move the kernel files to a place where
the boot loader will find them. Hopefully this can be
removed as the wheezy version of live-build stabilises.

At the time of writing, I have not successfully build
a usb-hdd image ("no operating system found" problem)
This is a shame, because it's my preferred image type
(allowing as it does a persistent home partition on the
same device).
